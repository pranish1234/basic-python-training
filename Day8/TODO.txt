    absolute vs realtive import


When a module named XXX is imported, 
the interpreter first searches for a built-in module with that name. 
If not found, it then searches for a file named XXX.py in a 
list of directories given by the variable sys.path. 

sys.path is initialized from these locations:

- The directory containing the input script (or the current directory when no file is specified).
- PYTHONPATH (a list of directory names, with the same syntax as the shell variable PATH).
- The installation-dependent default.
